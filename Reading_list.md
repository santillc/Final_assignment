## Primary manuscript:
ERGO: A pilot study of ketogenic diet in recurrent glioblastoma: https://www.spandidos-publications.com/ijo/44/6/1843
The keto diet originated in use for the treatment/management for epilepsy. However, today many people promote and use the keto diet for weight loss.
Such use is controversial as it was not meant for that type of use. This paper discusses the use of the keto diet for the management
of brain cancer.
